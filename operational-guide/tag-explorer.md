# Tag Explorer

The tag explorer is where you can analyze consumption based on tags that you have defined.

The location hierarchy (defined within iviva's Location application) is also shown here and lets you analyze data at each location in the hierarchy.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [marking-the-main-meter.md](../getting-started/configuring-the-application/marking-the-main-meter.md "mention") for information on getting accurate location-based consumption data
{% endhint %}



The Tag Explorer looks like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On the left side you have all of your tags, organized in a tree structure and separated by tag type.

You can click on any tag to view consumption data about that tag. The right side shows the [consumption-analysis-tool.md](consumption-analysis-tool.md "mention") to view consumption data about that tag.



You can select a single tag from each tag type and view consumption about it. If you select a parent tag, the consumption data will have the aggregated data from all child tags as well.

You can also combine tags from different tag types.



In the example below:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We have selected to view consumption data for all 'equipment' tagged items that also have the location as 'Precinct1'

You can select a single tag from each tag group and see data that intersects all the selected tags.

You can unselect a tag by clicking again on it.



If you scroll down below the consumption analysis tool you can see the list of meters, virtual meters and meter groups that contributed to the selected tag (or tags).
