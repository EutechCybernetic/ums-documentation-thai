# Operational Guide

The key operational tasks in the UMS application are to be able to track and report on consumption data across different utilities.

The application provides 3 tools for doing this:

1. The meter explorer
2. The tag explorer
3. Dashboards

## Accessing these tools

The operational tools are categorized by the meter type.\
Each meter type has a separate section to explore meters and tags.

Dashboards however, are consolidated and customizable and accessible from the dashboard menu.

All of these tools are accessible from the sidebar.
