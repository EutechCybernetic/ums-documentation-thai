# Dashboards

The UMS application currently provides 3 customizable dashboards that are accessible from the side bar.

Note that these dashboards are configured by an admin user and are available to all users who have access to the UMS application.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to change the number of dashboards available or change the titles of them, contact your iviva account manager for assistance
{% endhint %}



If a user wants their own custom dashboard, a new portal interface can be created for them in iviva.

These dashboards function like regular iviva dashboards with the difference that any changes made by the user are permanent for all users of the application.

You can add/edit/remove any widget to this dashboard.

It need not be limited to UMS related widgets.



## Editing the dashboard

You can use the 'pencil' icon on the top right corner of the screen to edit the dashboard.

Going into 'Edit' mode lets you re-arrange widgets easily, re-configure them, remove them and add new widgets.

Once in edit mode, you have the following options:

The UMS app itself provides 2 widgets.



### Consumption Analysis Widget

This widget provides the full consumption analysis tool as a widget.

You can save the filters in the tool and it will automatically get saved in the widget.

See [consumption-analysis-tool.md](consumption-analysis-tool.md "mention") for more information about how to use this widget.



### Utility Baseline Comparison

This widget gives you an at-glance view of the overall consumption of various utility types.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [utility-types.md](../readme/concepts/utility-types.md "mention") for more information on configuring different utility types.
{% endhint %}

It shows the total consumption for the given time period and location for each utility and how it compares to the corresponding baseline that was selected



There 2 variations of the utility baseline comparison widget but they both work the same way.

Use the location filter to choose the location that you wish to see comparison data for. You would generally pick a building or site here.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [marking-the-main-meter.md](../getting-started/configuring-the-application/marking-the-main-meter.md "mention") for more information on how to make this data accurage
{% endhint %}

You can also pick a baseline to compare against and a default date range.

When you make changes, a 'pin' icon appears on the top right.

Click that icon to 'pin' the changes on this widget.

When you pin changes, you are saving those filters so they are loaded everytime the dashboard loads.

This change is applied for all users when done in a dashboard in the UMS application.

Note that you can add the same widget multiple times and each can have different pinned values.
