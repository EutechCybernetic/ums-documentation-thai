# Dashboards

Start by selecting the dashboard from the sidebar

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt="" width="243"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

In the main area, you can see the widgets that have been added to the dashboard (if any).

If you have permissions, you can edit the dashboard and add/resize/remove/configure widgets.

To make modifications to the dashboard, you need to go into 'Edit' mode.

Click on the 'pencil' icon on the top right corner of the screen to go into edit mode.

Once in edit mode, you can edit widgets, resize them, delete them and add new widgets.

When adding new widgets, you can choose from the library of available widgets.

{% hint style="info" %}
The widgets available in the library will vary and may contain custom widgets that were built specifically for that installation
{% endhint %}

The 'Consumption' widget is the standard widget that comes with UMS and has a lot of flexible analytics and visualization options within it.&#x20;
