# Understanding the user interface

_Note: Like all applications, UMS will constantly be updated and improved and the interface may change a little between versions - however the concepts are all the same_

The main interface for the UMS application looks like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The right side is the content area and the left side is your navigation sidebar.

You can use the sidebar to navigate through the different parts of the application and the content for each part is on the right side.



The main sections of the application are:

1. Dashboards - multiple dashboards can be configured and each can have its own collection of widgets on it that can be customized
2. Configuration - this section of the application lets you configure various elements of the application - all meter and tag and related configuration is done here.&#x20;
3. Advanced - access to advanced operational and admin level features
4. Utility Types - each utility type will have its own section in the sidebar that lets you inspect
   1. meteres related to that utility type
   2. explore tags related to that utility type
