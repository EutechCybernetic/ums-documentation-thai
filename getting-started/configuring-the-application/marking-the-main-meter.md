# Marking The Main Meter

When you have parent meters and sub meters, you may need to mark a specific meter as the main meter for that location which would be used to track the consumption in that location.

To do this, go to 'Advanced' in the sidebar and then the 'Meter To Tag Mapping' tab.

Over here, choose the utility type, and then add a new mapping.

Select 'Location' as the tag type and then choose the location.

Under 'Resource Type' choose which type of meter (normal meter, virtual meter or meter group) that you wish to map to the location.

Then, in the 'Resource' section, select the specific meter or group you wish to map.

Submit your changes.

This meter (or group) is now the main meter for that location.

Whenever you select a location for viewing consumption data, this meter's consumption will be used.



{% hint style="info" %}
This applies only to that location. Not any sub location. You need to separately map a main meter for sub locations, if those sub locations also have distribution boards or other kinds of parent meters in it
