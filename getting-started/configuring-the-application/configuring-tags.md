# Configuring Tags

Before you can apply tags to meters, virtual meters and groups, you first need to define your tag list.



## Tag Types

You start by defining the tag types and then add tags within that tag type.

Tag types describe the category for tags.

Examples: Systems, Tenant, Water Usage

These names are arbitrary and can be decided by you.

To start, go to the 'Configuration' section in the sidebar and then click on the 'Tags' tab.

Click on 'Add Tag Type'.

You can specify the type name and the initial tag to add for that type.

Even though its called 'Parent Tag' you can have multiple parent tags. More can be added later.



## Tags

Once you define tag types, under that type, you can define one or more tags for that type.

Tags can have a tree structure with sub tags and sub-sub tags and so on, under each tag.

You can move the mouse over a tag to edit, delete or add sub-tags to it.

This screen shows how to use the tag editor.
