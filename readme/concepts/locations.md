# Locations

The UMS application makes use of iviva's standard location hierarchy.

The full location tree that you configure within the iviva app is available in UMS.



You can attach meters, virtual meters and meter groups to locations. You can also configure extra properties for each location.

From a user interface standpoint, locations are shown as a separate entity but are internally treated as tags. However they are special in that you do not have to create the tags manually. They are synced from the iviva's Location application.
